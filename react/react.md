# **A first look at react**

We will talk about:

1. Why we need something like React?
2. What React is and how it compares to Vanilla JavaScript?
3. What are different options for setting up a new React application?
4. Use a tool called `Create-React_App` to build our very first React project.

## **Why do front-end frameworks exist?**

So why not simply use Vanilla JavaScript to build our applications?

Before around 2010 all websites were **server-side rendered** websites. A website is assembled on the backend based on data and templates. The resulting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code is then sent to the client-side. The browser then takes this code and paints it to the screen. All websites built with Wordpress are of this kind. The JavaScript used in this kind of websites was initially only to add some simple dynamics to the page, like simple animations, hover effects, and other stuff. Usually a popular library called **jQuery** was used for this purpose.

However, developers started to write more and more JavaScript code to be executed by the browser, and this led to fully fledged web applications which then led to the rise of so-called **single-page applications**. These are webpages that are rendered on the client and not on the server.

In client-side rendering, the process of rendering a webpage is shifted from the server to the client. We call these not webpages anymore, but **web applications**. A web application gets its data from the backend, usually by consuming an **API**. The application renders the screen for each view of the application. This single-page application feels as if you were using a native desktop or phone application.

There are several problems with using Vanilla JavaScript for building large-scale applications. Keep in mind that building any front-end web application is all about **handling data** and **displaying data** in a user interface. The most important task of a single-page application (and really of any application and website) is to keep the user interface in sync with the data, or in other words, to make sure that the UI always displays the current state of the data. This have proved to be a hard task to perform! Without a framework, it would be virtually impossible to keep the huge amount of data in an application in sync with a super-complex UI. Why?

1. Building a complex front-end with Vanilla JavaScript alone requires large amount of direct **DOM traversing and manipulation**, and this will lead to a huge mess of spaghetti code.
2. In Vanilla JavaScript apps, **states** such as simple text or numbers are often simply **stored right in the DOM**, right in the HTML elements themselves rather in a central place in the application. This results in many part of the app accessing and changing that DOM state directly. This will introduce many bugs into our application.

So in conclusion, this is manly why framworks exist:

1. Keeping a user interface in sync with data is really hard and takes a lot of work.
2. Frameworks enforce a correct way of structuring and writing code, therefore contributing to solving the problem of spaghetti code.
3. Frameworks give developers and teams a consistent way of building front-end applications.

## **What is React?**

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. But let's extend this definition. React is an extremely **popular**, **declarative**, **component-based**, **state-driven** JavaScript library for building user interfaces, created by Facebook.

- **Based on components:** components are the building blocks of user interfaces in React, such as buttons, input fields, search bars and so on. Basically, what React does is to take components and draw them on webpages. We build complex UIs by building and combining multiple components.
- **Declarative:** We describe how components look like and how they work using a declarative syntax called **JSX**. So React is a huge abstraction away from the DOM, we never touch the DOM. JSX is a syntax that combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as referncing other components. If we never touch the DOM, how does React update the UI? This is where state comes to play.
- **State-driven:** React keeps the data in sync with the UI. Let's call this data "state" from now on. Whenever the state changes, we manually update the state in our application, and React will automatically re-render the UI to reflect the latest state. In other words, React actually reacts to state changes by re-rendering the UI.
- **JavaScript library:** React is actually just a JavaScript library. React is only the **view** layer. We need to pick multiple external libraries to build a complete application, for instance, for routing or for data fetching. To address this issue, multiple frameworks have been built on top of React, such as **NextJS** and **Remix**.

## **Setting up a new React project: The options**

The two options that are available for setting up a react project:

1. **Create-React-App tool:** a complete starter kit for React applications. The nice thing about this is that everything is already configured in it: An app created with this tool automatically comes with a development server, Webpack for module bundling, and important developer tools such as ESLint, Prettier, Jest, Babel, etc. The problem with this tool is that it was built many years ago, and uses some slow and **outdated technologies** like Webpack. So don't use this tool for real-world projects anymore. Only use for tutorials or experiments.
2. **Vite build tool:** use this tool for **real-world applications**. It is a modern build tool that contains a template for setting up React applications. This needs you to manually set up ESLint and other things. This can go wrong sometimes. So why use Vite? For its extremely fast page refreshment when the code changes. This is called **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**. Also bundling is extremely fast in Vite.

But we also have other options in addition to the two options mentioned above. It is to use a React framework like **NextJS** or **Remix**. A framework like NextJS contains solutions for things like routing, data fetching, and server-side rendering, which are things that React itself does not provide easily out of the box. So a React framework is something built on top of React and makes it even easier to build applications.

This sounds great, but only for some applications. **Vanilla React applications** are still very important. It only makes sense to use React frameworks for building actual products, not for learning React.

### **Setting up a project with `create-react-app`**

Here are the steps you should follow:

1. Open up the command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to start your project. Then type this command:

```
npx create-react-app@5 <project-name>
```

This will create a new folder with the project name defined in the command. It will also download a lot of files which will take a few minutes. As a result, you will see in the newly created folder a structured set of files and folders. This structure is designed in this way because developers thought it was the best possible structure. But it could be completely different.

```
- node_modules (dir)
- public (dir)
- src (dir)
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
    reportWebVitals.js
    setupTests.js
.gitignore
package.lock.json
package.json
```

In the `src` folder we have some files that we don't need and we will get rid of. So in order to create a project from scratch, we will select all files in this folder and delete them. This will make the application show you an error.

We will then create an `index.js` file in this folder. Remember that this file needs to be named `index.js` because **Webpack** expects the entry points to be called that. Inside this file, we will first import React:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
```

Next up, we will create our `App` component. It is not necessary to call it App, but it is necessary to start its name with a capital letter. From here on, you can go on to the [Core Concepts](#core-concepts-of-building-react-apps) section of this file.

The `public` folder contains all the assets that will end up in the final application, such as all the images and an `index.html` file that contains a `<div>` element with the id `root`. Remember that Webpack, which is the module bundler here, will automatically look into the `public` folder to find the assets of our application, such as images, etc.

# **Core concepts of building React apps**

We will talk about **Components**, **Props**, and **JSX**. We will learn how components are the building blocks of React applications and how to create and reuse them using the powerfull JSX syntax.

We will also share data between components using Props and learn about rendering **lists**, **conditional rendering**, and more. Looking at a React app, there is nothing that is not a component, or at least not inside of some component. As mentioned before, what React does is to basically take components and draw them on to a webpage. In technical terms, React renders a "View" for each component, and all these views together make up the UI.

It is important to remember that each component has its own:

1. Data (props)
2. JavaScript Logic
3. Appearance (JSX)

## **JSX**

JSX is a declarative syntax to describe how components look like and how they work based on their data and logic. In practice, this means that each component must return one block of JSX, which React will then use to render the component on the UI.

JSX is similar to HTML, but it is actually an extension of JavaScript that allows us to embed JavaScript, CSS, and React components into HTML.

If react is a JavaScript framework, how does it understand this HTML-looking code? Remember that JSX is an extension of JavaScript, which means that there is a simple way of converting JSX to JavaScript. This is done by **Babel**, which was automatically included in our application by `create-react-app`.

Each JSX element is converted to a `React.createElement()` function call. Remember that browsers don't understand JSX, they only understand HTML. So our JSX is converted into `createElement()` function calls, which in the end creates the HTML elements that we see on the screen.

### **Declarative JSX**

Let's first review what is imperative, in order to understand what is declarative.

#### **Imperative appraoch**

When we try to build UIs using Vanilla JavaScript we use an imperative approach. It means that we manually select elements, traverse the DOM, and attach event handlers to elements. Then as soon as an event happens, we give the browser a step-by-step instruction on how to mutate DOM until we reach the desired UI.

So in the imperative approach, we tell the browser exactly **how to do things**. However, doing this in a complex app is virtually impossible! So we use React in order to implement a declarative approach.

#### **Declarative appraoch**

Declarative approach means to describe what the UI should look like at all times, always based on the current data that is in the component. We know that this data is actually **props** and **state**. So basically, we JSX to describe the UI based on props and state. All this, happens without any DOM manipulation at all!

So in the declarative approach, we tell the browser **what we want to achieve**. It helps us developers to never think of touching the DOM. Instead, we should only think of the UI as a reflection of the current data.

### **Rules of JSX**

1. JSX works essentially like HTML, but we can enter JavaScript mode by using `{}`.
2. Inside the JavaScript mode, we can place any JavaScript expressions. Example: reference variables, create arrays or objects, `.map()`, ternary opertor. But statements are not allowed (`if/else`, `for`, `switch`)
3. A piece of JSX produces a JavaScript expression. By that we mean that this:

```js
const el = <h1>Hello React!</h1>;
```

is converted to:

```js
const el = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello React!");
```

This fact has 2 important implications:

- We can place other pieces of JSX inside `{}`
- We can write JSX anywhere inside a component (in `if/else`, assign to variables, pass it into functions)

4. A piece of JSX can only have one root element. If you need more, use `<React.Fragment>`.

### **Extracting JSX into a new component**

Let's talk on the `Footer` component example. As we notice that the JSX inside this component is growing too much, we can extract JSX into another component. We simply define another component that returns a JSX.

```js
function Order(props) {
  return (
    <div className="order">
      <p>
        We're open until {props.closeHour}:00. Come visit us or order online.
      </p>
      <button className="btn">Order</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We would obviously have to udpate the `Footer` component like this:

```js
function Footer() {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  const openHour = 12;
  const closeHour = 22;
  const isOpen = hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour;
  console.log(isOpen);

  return (
    <footer className="footer">
      {isOpen ? (
        <Order closeHour={closeHour} />
      ) : (
        <p>
          We're happy to welcome you between {openHour} and {closeHour}
        </p>
      )}
    </footer>
  );
}
```

So we take out a part of the JSX, and replace it with the result of calling the `Order` component by passing the `closeHour` prop into it, because it depends on it.

## **Components**

Components are the most fundamental concepts in React. React applications are entirely made out of components.

In a real-world application, we can identify main components, and if we look with more precision, we can also identify some smaller components inside other major components. In React applications, it is very normal to **nest** components inside other components.

These nested components may be of the **list** type, which means that their appearance is the same, but their data is different. So they are actually the same component that is being reused to display varying information. This can be handled using **props** which enables us to pass data between components.

One thing that can help to analyze our components is the component tree which clarifies the hierarchy that exists between the components (parent and child components).

### **Rendering the `root` component and strict mode**

Inside the `index.js` file which we normally place inside the `src` folder of our project, we first import `React` and `ReactDOM` libraries.

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
```

Then we add the first component which is usually called `App` and its name needs to start with a capital letter.

```js
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello React!</h1>;
}
```

Now in order to render this component to the DOM, we would have to use the `createRoot` method that is available on `ReactDOM`. This method receives as argument the `<div>` element with the ID `root` in the `index.html` file which is currently located in the `public` folder.

> We are not allowed to return more than one element in a single JSX. If we want to include more than one element, we would have to wrap them in one single parent element, like a `div`. This can also be handled using React [fragments]().

```js
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
```

Now this `root` object has the `render` method available on it, and we can use it to render our `App` component. The `render` method accepts JSX as argument.

```js
root.render(<App />);
```

Now to activate **strict mode**, we can do the rendering in another way. So instead of directly rendering the `App` component as the root component, we can wrap the `App` component inside a `React.StrictMode` component.

```js
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

The only thing that strict mode does is that during development, it will render our components twice to find certain bugs and to check if we are using outdated parts of the React API.

We can now start our project using the NPM command below, since it is already defined as an NPM script in the `package.json` file.

```
npm run start
```

### **Creating and reusing a component**

In React, we write new components using functions. Also, there are 2 important rules as we define components as functions.

1. The function name needs to start in **uppercase**.
2. The function needs to return some **markup**, usually in the form of JSX, but we can also return nothing, like `null`.

```js
function Pizza() {
  return <h2>Pizza</h2>;
}
```

Up until this point this component cannot appear in the UI since we are not incluing this new component anywhere. We can include this in our main component which is usually called `App`. This way we are actually **nesting** the `Pizza` component inside the `App` component.

```js
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello React!</h1><Pizza />;
}
```

> Nesting a component inside another component never means to write the child component's function inside the parent component function. The two functions should be written separately, but the child component will be called or inserted into the parent component as an element. Of course, React will still work if we put the child function inside the parent function, but it is a really bad practice.

But remember that each component can only return one element. So the `<h1>` and the `<Pizza />` element should be wrapped in another element, like a `<div>`.

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello React!</h1>
      <Pizza />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `Pizza` component is now **reusable**, meaning that we can include its returned JSX in any of our other components simply by inserting the `<Pizza />`. For now, this will re-render the `Pizza` component with the same data over and over, but we can update it each time we insert it by using [**props**](#using-props-in-a-component).

#### **Using public assets in components**

In order to use an image inside a component we include an `<img/>` tag in the `return` statement of the component. Note that if we are actually returning more than one elements, we should wrap them all in another whole `<div>` element.

```js
function Pizza() {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src="pizzas/spinaci.jpg" alt="Pizza spinaci" />
      <h2>Pizza Spinaci</h2>
      <p>Tomato, mozarella, spinach, and ricotta cheese</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> When writing the address to a specific image, you should consider the `public` folder as the root directory and start the image file path from that root.

#### **Implementing JavaScript logic in components**

This will include writing JavaScript logic in components. Until this point, we have already written some JavaScript logic, but it was only inside JSX. But since components are JavaScript functions, we can do any JavaScript code inside them.

```js
function Footer() {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  const openHour = 12;
  const closeHour = 22;
  const isOpen = hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour;
  console.log(isOpen);

  return (
    <footer>{new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}, We're currently open!</footer>
  );
}
```

Notice how we have used regular JavaScript logic before returning the JSX. Also keep in mind that in order to implement JavaScript logic in JSX, we should always insert the JavaScript code inside `{}`.

> You will probably receive every result twice, and that is becasue of the strict mode.

## Props

Up until this point, we have learned about a component's appearance and logic. We also know that React renders a component based on its current data and that the UI will always be in sync with that data. This data is made out of **props** and **state**. There are actually more, but for now these two matter.

State is **internal component data** that can be updated by the component's **logic**, while props is the data coming from the **parent component**, so from outside. So it is the parent component that owns the data, and therefore it cannot be modified by the child component. Props can only be updated by the parent component itself. So keep in mind that **Props are read-only, they are immutable**. Therefore, if you need to mutate props, you actually need state.

Why props are immutable? Because props are just simple objects. Mutating props would affect the parent component, that is how objects work in JavaScript. If you change an object that is located outside a function, that function has then created side effects. React is all about pure functions that don't produce side effects. Components have to be pure in terms of their props and state, because this allows React to optimize apps, avoid bugs, and make apps predictable.

Props essentially defines how we pass data between components, in particular, from parent components to child components. Props are an essential React tool to configure and to customize components. You can imagine props as settings that we can use to make a parent component control how its child components should look like. Props are just like function arguments passed to regular JavaScript functions.

### **Props make one-way data flow**

This means that in React applications, data can only be passed from parent to child components which happens by using props. There are multiple reasons thar React uses this one-way data flow:

1. Makes applications more predictable and easier to understand for developers.
2. Makes applications easier to debug, as we have more control over the data
3. This is more performant.

Now you might ask, what if I actually wanted to pass some state up to a parent component? There is a very clever way to do that, but we will learn that later.

### **Passing and reciving props**

To define props we do it in 2 steps:

1. Pass the props
2. Receive the props

Imagine we have a `Menu` component that is going to pass props into a `Pizza` component. This would the most basic way to implement:

```js
function Menu() {
  return (
    <main className="menu">
      <h2>Our menu</h2>
      <Pizza
        name="Pizza Spinaci"
        ingredients="Tomato, mozarella, spinach, and ricotta cheese"
        photoName="pizzas/spinaci.jpg"
        price={10}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

Notice how we have defined props similar to regular attributes in HTML.

> The order in which we define props as attributes is not important. Also note that you can insert anything as props. It is limited to strings or numbers. It can be objects, or even other React components. However, if you want to insert anything but strings, you should first enter JavaScript mode by typing `{}`.

Now the `Pizza` component will be able to receive these props in an object called `props`. The attributes will be available as properties on the `props` object.

```js
function Pizza(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={props.photoName} alt={props.name} />
      <h2>{props.name}</h2>
      <p>{props.ingredients}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> The `props` object is always available on all components, but if we don't pass anything into a component as argument, it will simply be an empty object.

#### **Rendering lists with props**

Rendering a list is when we have an array and we want to render an element for each component of the array. We will continue the example mentioned above for this use case.

We should now update the `Menu` component we defined in the example above:

```js
function Menu() {
  return (
    <main className="menu">
      <h2>Our menu</h2>
      <ul>
        {pizzaData.map((pizza) => (
          <Pizza pizzaObj={pizza} key={pizza.name} />
        ))}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}
```

> This is the conventional practice in React that in these cases, the parent component passes the whole data object as props to the child component.

We would also have to update the `Pizza` component to receive the whole pizza object for each pizza on the menu.

```js
function Pizza(props) {
  return (
    <li className="pizza">
      <img src={props.pizzaObj.photoName} alt={props.pizzaObj.name} />
      <div>
        <h3>{props.pizzaObj.name}</h3>
        <p>{props.pizzaObj.ingredients}</p>
        <span>{props.pizzaObj.price}</span>
      </div>
    </li>
  );
}
```

> Note how we also defined a `key` prop in the `Menu` component. If we didn't do it, React would give us an error in the console saying that "Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop." This means that each time we render a list, as we did in the `Menu` component using the `.map()` method, each of the items that gets rendered needs also a `key` property or attribute. This is a prop that is internal to React and it uses it to do some performance optimization. We should pass a unique value for the `key` prop. In this example, we used the pizza name as the key for each pizza.

> Also keep in mind that we should still keep using semantic HTML in React. Notice how we did that by using `ul` and `li` tags in the `Menu` and `Pizza` components respectively.

> It is a good practice to destructure props immediately when they are received in a component. This lets us quickly figure out what props the component is receiving, without having to look at the parent component in the chain. For instance, for the `Pizza` component mentioned above, we can do it like this:

```js
function Pizza({ pizzaObj }) {
  if (pizzaObj.soldOut) return null;

  return (
    <li className="pizza">
      <img src={pizzaObj.photoName} alt={pizzaObj.name} />
      <div>
        <h3>{pizzaObj.name}</h3>
        <p>{pizzaObj.ingredients}</p>
        <span>{pizzaObj.price}</span>
      </div>
    </li>
  );
}
```

#### **Conditional rendering**

This is a very important technique that we use all the time in React. There are 3 ways of rendering some JSX or an entire component in React.

Keep these notes in mind:

1. Use the ternary operator when you need to return some piece of JSX based on a condition.
2. Sometimes you may need to return something entirely different in a certain condition. In these situations you may use multiple `return` statements based on conditions.

##### **With `&&`**

This basically involves using the short circuiting technique of JavaScript. Short circuiting means that you combine a condition with something that should be returned. If the condition becomes `true` or if it contains a truthy value, the second thing will actually be returned.

In this example, we want to render the footer content if the `isOpen` variable contains `true`.

```js
function Footer() {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  const openHour = 12;
  const closeHour = 22;
  const isOpen = hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour;
  console.log(isOpen);
  return (
    <footer className="footer">
      {isOpen && (
        <div className="order">
          <p>We're open until {closeHour}:00. Come visit us or order online.</p>
          <button className="btn">Order</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </footer>
  );
}
```

As another example, take the `Menu` component that we previously mentioned. We want to render the `ul` only if there are some pizzas avilable on the `pizzaData` array.

```js
function Menu() {
  const numPizzas = pizzaData.length;
  return (
    <main className="menu">
      <h2>Our menu</h2>
      {numPizzas > 0 && (
        <ul className="pizzas">
          {pizzas.map((pizza) => (
            <Pizza pizzaObj={pizza} key={pizza.name} />
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </main>
  );
}
```

This will make it so that if the `pizzaData` array is empty, then the whole `ul` won't be rendered.

> We should not implement the condition by simply writing `numPizzas` as a truthy/falsey value. In this case, if `numPizzas` is 0, then it would be a falsey value and short circuiting will happen. Therefore, what will be returned is not what we wrote after the `&&`. Instead, the value of `numPizzas` will be returned and rendered on the page. We don't want that. So we should actually write the condition in a way that becomes `true` or `false`.

##### **With ternary operator**

We are now going to do the same thing with the ternary operator. The advantage of using ternary operator is that we can display some alternative.

```js
function Menu() {
  const pizzas = pizzaData;
  const numPizzas = pizzas.length;
  return (
    <main className="menu">
      <h2>Our menu</h2>
      {numPizzas > 0 ? (
        <ul className="pizzas">
          {pizzas.map((pizza) => (
            <Pizza pizzaObj={pizza} key={pizza.name} />
          ))}
        </ul>
      ) : null}
    </main>
  );
}
```

Let's also use this for the `Footer` component:

```js
function Footer() {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  const openHour = 12;
  const closeHour = 22;
  const isOpen = hour >= openHour && hour <= closeHour;
  console.log(isOpen);

  return (
    <footer className="footer">
      {isOpen ? (
        <div className="order">
          <p>We're open until {closeHour}:00. Come visit us or order online.</p>
          <button className="btn">Order</button>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>
          We're happy to welcome you between {openHour} and {closeHour}
        </p>
      )}
    </footer>
  );
}
```

> We can use ternary operator to render the text content of a JSX element based on a condition. We can also use the ternary operator to insert class names based on a condition. Take the `Pizza` component for instance where we want to add the `sold-out` class name to any of the pizzas that are sold out. We also want to show the "SOLD OUT" text content instead of pizza's price in the `<span>` element that we defined in the JSX.

```js
function Pizza({ pizzaObj }) {
  return (
    <li className={`pizza ${pizzaObj.soldOut ? "sold-out" : ""}`}>
      <img src={pizzaObj.photoName} alt={pizzaObj.name} />
      <div>
        <h3>{pizzaObj.name}</h3>
        <p>{pizzaObj.ingredients}</p>
        <span>{pizzaObj.soldOut ? "SOLD OUT" : pizzaObj.price}</span>
      </div>
    </li>
  );
}
```

##### **With multiple `return` statements**

Up until this point, all our components only ever had one `return` statement. But as JavaScript allows us, we can use multiple return statements based on some condition. Of course, only one of the `return` statements would be executed in the component, and that is why we implement this based on some condition.

For instance, if we want to render a `Pizza` component if only it is not sold out, we can do this:

```js
function Pizza(props) {
  if (props.pizzaObj.soldOut) return null;

  return (
    <li className="pizza">
      <img src={props.pizzaObj.photoName} alt={props.pizzaObj.name} />
      <div>
        <h3>{props.pizzaObj.name}</h3>
        <p>{props.pizzaObj.ingredients}</p>
        <span>{props.pizzaObj.price}</span>
      </div>
    </li>
  );
}
```

## React Fragments

Basically, a React fragment lets us group elements without leaving any trace in the DOM.

Remember that a piece of JSX, no matter where it is defined, can only have one root element. Previously, we said that one way to fix this is to wrap our elements in a single parent element, like a `div`. This can potentially mess up the styles and appearances that we defined for the page. So we can use fragments.

You will again wrap the elements that you want to return as JSX in a parent element, but this parent element will not be an actual HTML element. It won't be inserted into the HTML code of the page. Only React will know about this. The parent element's opening would be `<>` and its closing would be `</>`.

```js
function Menu() {
  const pizzas = pizzaData;
  const numPizzas = pizzas.length;
  return (
    <main className="menu">
      <h2>Our menu</h2>

      {numPizzas > 0 ? (
        <>
          <p>
            Authentic Italian cuisine. 6 creative dishes to choose from. All
            from our stone stove, all organic, all delicious.
          </p>
          <ul className="pizzas">
            {pizzas.map((pizza) => (
              <Pizza pizzaObj={pizza} key={pizza.name} />
            ))}
          </ul>
        </>
      ) : (
        <p>We're still working on our menu. Please come back later.</p>
      )}
    </main>
  );
}
```

> Sometimes we need to add a `key` to the React fragment, for instance, when we are using it to render a list. Then the fragment would have to be written in a different way. The wrapper element will now be `<React.Fragment>` and then we would be able to add a `key` prop to it.

## **Styling React applications**

There are several ways to style components. React does not really care about how we do it. React is more of a library than a framework.

### **Inline styling**

In HTML, we can style elements using the `style` attribute. But it works a bit different in JSX. We cannot assign a string to the style attribute as we did with the normal HTML syntax. The style attribute in JSX should receive a JavaScript object containing the styles defined as properties.

```js
function Header() {
  return (
    <h1 style={{ color: "red", fontSize: "48px" }}>Fast React Pizza Co.</h1>
  );
}
```

Note how we used the first set of `{}` to enter JavaScript mode in the JSX, and then used another set of `{}` which indicates the JavaScript object that is used to define style properties.

> There is no problem in using inline styles in JSX, but this can easily get out of control when designing large-scale applications.

> Some style properties that we type their names with dashes in CSS, should be written in cammelCase in JavaScript. For instance, `font-size` in CSS should be written as `fontSize` in JSX.

> The JavaScript object inserted into the style attribute can be defined separately outisde the JSX.

### **External CSS or Sass**

We should first import the external CSS file into the JavaScript file where our components and their JSX are declared.

```js
import "./index.css";
```

We then have to insert class names that we used in the external CSS file. Keep in mind that in JSX, we cannot use the `class` attribute as we do it in HTML. Instead, we should use `className`.

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <Header />
      <Menu />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

> The external CSS file should normally be located in the `src` folder.

> Styles included here as an external CSS file are global styles, they are not scoped to the components where they are used.

### **CSS modules**

### **Tailwind CSS**

## **Separation of concerns in React**

[Notes will be added later.]

Before React we had one technology per file, but with React we have one component per file. So separation of concerns is still there, but in a different paradigm.
